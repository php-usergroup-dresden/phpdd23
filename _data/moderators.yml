      For the past two years, Anke has been moderating NeosCon, a community conference for the open source CMS Neos. 
      
      As a dedicated developer at queo GmbH, Anke also likes to think outside the box and helps organise local meetups as well as motivating others to get involved in the community.
      
      We are very happy that Anke will guide us through the event on this special day!
